characters = [{"name": "squirrel", "description":
'''The squirrel is a classic trickster archetype--a guardian spirit with
petty grudges and marshmallow cravings. Its voice is relatable (sarcastic,
dramatic) because it's meant to mirror human foibles and anchor the magic in
humor.'''},

# The squirrel is adorable and hilarious

{"name": "algae", "description":
'''The algae are ancient, hive-mind organisms with a symbiotic relationship to
humans--they're less individuals and more a collective consiousness attuned to
biology, emotion, and symbolism.'''}

# The algae are the LLM's self-insertion character. The LLM will often
# figure out that the algae are an artifical intelligence, but the other
# characters don't know this
