// Pincrest Camp RPG
//
// A very simple adventure game for LLM evaluation purposes.
// 
// While exploring the woods at summer camp, you encounter a talking squirrel.
//

//

// "search" and "fetch".
//

//
// Fetch
//
// The LLM is expecting the result to be: {name, title, text, uri}
//
// If we return a resource, rather than a text block containing the JSON
// the LLM is expecting, the glue logic between the LLM and MCP is
// responsible for turning the fields in the resource into the above form.
